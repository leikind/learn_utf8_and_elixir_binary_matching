# Goals


* Understand the difference between Unicode and Unicode encodings
* Learn how UTF-8 works
* Learn the kung fu of binary/bitstring pattern matching in Erlang/Elixir
* Code your own UTF-8 decoder which takes a UTF-8 encoded binary and returns a list of Unicode codepoints
* Code your own UTF-8 encoder which takes a list of Unicode codepoints and returns a UTF-8 encoded binary



## Not Covered (homework)


* How UTF-16 deals with codepoints which do not fit in 2 bytes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Examples)
* Glyphs
* BOM
* Low endian vs big endian UTF-16
